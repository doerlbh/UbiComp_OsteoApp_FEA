\begin{abstract}
The project aims to conduct a finite element analysis (FEA) on a bone-like structure to simulate the vibration properties of a bone or arm. This simulation is supportive to OsteoApp, a smartphone app for personal osteoporosis screening that tests bone density and tells people if they are at risk for bone disease. OsteoApp uses a vibration technique that takes advantage of the accelerometers on a hand-held smartphone to measure bone stiffness and density, based on the vibrations that pass through the user's arm when the elbow is tapped. The FEA simulation in this study can help us better understand the relationship between the external tapping with the measured signals. This study is conducted by Baihan Lin, mentored by Morelle Arian and Josh Fromm, and supervised by Prof. Shwetak Patel.

\section{Introduction}

The finite element analysis (FEA) on a bone-like structure to simulate the vibration properties of a bone or arm. This simulation is supportive to OsteoApp, a smartphone app for personal osteoporosis screening that tests bone density and tells people if they are at risk for bone disease. OsteoApp uses a vibration technique that takes advantage of the accelerometers on a hand-held smartphone to measure bone stiffness and density, based on the vibrations that pass through the user's arm when the elbow is tapped. The FEA simulation in this study can help us better understand the relationship between the external tapping with the measured signals.

    Caption style.  One-line captions should be centered; multi-line
    should be justified. }~\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{References and Citations}

Use a numbered list of references at the end of the article, ordered
alphabetically by last name of first author, and referenced by numbers
in
brackets~\cite{acm_categories,ethics,Klemmer:2002:WSC:503376.503378}.
Your references should be published materials accessible to the
public. Internal technical reports may be cited only if they are
easily accessible (i.e., you provide the address for obtaining the
report within your citation) and may be obtained by any reader for a
nominal fee. Proprietary information may not be cited. Private
communications should be acknowledged in the main text, not referenced
(e.g., ``[Borriello, personal communication]'').

References should be in ACM citation format:
\url{http://acm.org/publications/submissions/latex_style}. This
includes citations to internet
resources~\cite{acm_categories,cavender:writing,CHINOSAUR:venue,psy:gangnam}
according to ACM format, although it is often appropriate to include
URLs directly in the text, as above.

%   Mather:2000:MUT, Zellweger:2001:FAO:504216.504224}. For papers from
% conference proceedings, include the title of the paper and an
% abbreviated name of the conference (e.g., for Interact 2003
% proceedings, use \textit{Proc. Interact 2003}). Do not include the
% location of the conference or the exact date; do include the page
% numbers if available. See the examples of citations at the end of this
% document. Within this template file, use the \texttt{References} style
% for the text of your citation.

\end{table}

\section{Sections}

The heading of a section should be in Helvetica or Arial 9-point bold,
all in capitals. Sections should \textit{not} be numbered.

\subsection{Subsections}

Headings of subsections should be in Helvetica or Arial 9-point bold
with initial letters capitalized.  For sub-sections and
sub-subsections, a word like \emph{the} or \emph{of} is not
capitalized unless it is the first word of the heading.

\subsubsection{Sub-subsections}

Headings for sub-subsections should be in Helvetica or Arial 9-point
italic with initial letters capitalized.  Standard
\texttt{{\textbackslash}section}, \texttt{{\textbackslash}subsection},
and \texttt{{\textbackslash}subsubsection} commands will work fine in
this template.

\section{Figures/Captions}

Place figures and tables at the top or bottom of the appropriate
column or columns, on the same page as the relevant text (see
Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}). A figure or table may extend across both
columns to a maximum width of 17.78 cm (7 in.).

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.75\columnwidth]{figures/map}
  \caption{In this image, the map maximizes use of space. You can make
    figures as wide as you need, up to a maximum of the full width of
    both columns. Note that \LaTeX\ tends to render large figures on a
    dedicated page. Image: \ccbynd~ayman on
    Flickr.}~\label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure*}

Captions should be Times New Roman or Times Roman 9-point bold.  They
should be numbered (e.g., ``Table~\ref{tab:table1}'' or
``Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}''), centered and placed beneath the figure
or table.  Please note that the words ``Figure'' and ``Table'' should
be spelled out (e.g., ``Figure'' rather than ``Fig.'') wherever they
occur. Figures, like Figure~\ref{fig:figure2}, may span columns and
all figures should also include alt text for improved accessibility.
Papers and notes may use color figures, which are included in the page
limit; the figures must be usable when printed in black-and-white in
the proceedings.

The paper may be accompanied by a short video figure up to five
minutes in length. However, the paper should stand on its own without
the video figure, as the video may not be available to everyone who
reads the paper.  

\subsection{Inserting Images}
When possible, include a vector formatted graphic (i.e. PDF or EPS).
When including bitmaps,  use an image editing tool to resize the image
at the appropriate printing resolution (usually 300 dpi).

\section{Quotations}
Quotations may be italicized when \textit{``placed inline''} (Anab,
23F).

\begin{quote}
Longer quotes, when placed in their own paragraph, need not be
italicized or in quotation marks when indented (Ramon, 39M).  
\end{quote}

\section{Language, Style, and Content}

The written and spoken language of SIGCHI is English. Spelling and
punctuation may use any dialect of English (e.g., British, Canadian,
US, etc.) provided this is done consis- tently. Hyphenation is
optional. To ensure suitability for an international audience, please
pay attention to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Write in a straightforward style.
\item Try to avoid long or complex sentence structures.
\item Briefly define or explain all technical terms that may be
  unfamiliar to readers.
\item Explain all acronyms the first time they are used in your
  text---e.g., ``Digital Signal Processing (DSP)''.
\item Explain local references (e.g., not everyone knows all city
  names in a particular country).
\item Explain ``insider'' comments. Ensure that your whole audience
  understands any reference whose meaning you do not describe (e.g.,
  do not assume that everyone has used a Macintosh or a particular
  application).
\item Explain colloquial language and puns. Understanding phrases like
  ``red herring'' may require a local knowledge of English.  Humor and
  irony are difficult to translate.
\item Use unambiguous forms for culturally localized concepts, such as
  times, dates, currencies, and numbers (e.g., ``1--5--97'' or
  ``5/1/97'' may mean 5 January or 1 May, and ``seven o'clock'' may
  mean 7:00 am or 19:00). For currencies, indicate equivalences:
  ``Participants were paid {\fontfamily{txr}\selectfont \textwon}
  25,000, or roughly US \$22.''
\item Be careful with the use of gender-specific pronouns (he, she)
  and other gendered words (chairman, manpower, man-months). Use
  inclusive language that is gender-neutral (e.g., she or he, they,
  s/he, chair, staff, staff-hours, person-years). See the
  \textit{Guidelines for Bias-Free Writing} for further advice and
  examples regarding gender and other personal
  attributes~\cite{Schwartz:1995:GBF}. Be particularly aware of
  considerations around writing about people with disabilities.
\item If possible, use the full (extended) alphabetic character set
  for names of persons, institutions, and places (e.g.,
  Gr{\o}nb{\ae}k, Lafreni\'ere, S\'anchez, Nguy{\~{\^{e}}}n,
  Universit{\"a}t, Wei{\ss}enbach, Z{\"u}llighoven, \r{A}rhus, etc.).
  These characters are already included in most versions and variants
  of Times, Helvetica, and Arial fonts.
\end{itemize}

\section{Accessibility}
The Executive Council of SIGCHI has committed to making SIGCHI
conferences more inclusive for researchers, practitioners, and
educators with disabilities. As a part of this goal, the all authors
are asked to work on improving the accessibility of their
submissions. Specifically, we encourage authors to carry out the
following five steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Add alternative text to all figures
\item Mark table headings
\item Add tags to the PDF
\item Verify the default language
\item Set the tab order to ``Use Document Structure''
\end{enumerate}
For more information and links to instructions and resources, please
see: \url{http://chi2016.acm.org/accessibility}.  The
\texttt{{\textbackslash}hyperref} package allows you to create well tagged PDF files,
please see the preamble of this template for an example.

\section{Page Numbering, Headers and Footers}
Your final submission should not contain footer or header information
at the top or bottom of each page. Specifically, your final submission
should not include page numbers. Initial submissions may include page
numbers, but these must be removed for camera-ready. Page numbers will
be added to the PDF when the proceedings are assembled.

\section{Producing and Testing PDF Files}

We recommend that you produce a PDF version of your submission well
before the final deadline.  Your PDF file must be ACM DL
Compliant. The requirements for an ACM Compliant PDF are available at:
{\url{http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/ACM-distilling-settings.htm}}.

Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the same software we
will use when we receive it, Adobe Acrobat Reader Version 10. This is
widely available at no cost. Note that most
reviewers will use a North American/European version of Acrobat
reader, so please check your PDF accordingly.

When creating your PDF from Word, ensure that you generate a tagged
PDF from improved accessibility. This can be done by using the Adobe
PDF add-in, also called PDFMaker. Select Acrobat | Preferences from
the ribbon and ensure that ``Enable Accessibility and Reflow with
tagged Adobe PDF'' is selected. You can then generate a tagged PDF by
selecting ``Create PDF'' from the Acrobat ribbon.

\section{Conclusion}

It is important that you write for the SIGCHI audience. Please read
previous years' proceedings to understand the writing style and
conventions that successful authors have used. It is particularly
important that you state clearly what you have done, not merely what
you plan to do, and explain how your work is different from previously
published work, i.e., the unique contribution that your work makes to
the field. Please consider what the reader will learn from your
submission, and how they will find your work useful. If you write with
these questions in mind, your work is more likely to be successful,
both in being accepted into the conference, and in influencing the
work of our field.

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this
% for more info: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf

% Note that in a perfect world balance wants to be in the first

\section{References Format}
Your references should be published materials accessible to the
public. Internal technical reports may be cited only if they are
easily accessible and may be obtained by any reader for a nominal
fee. Proprietary information may not be cited. Private communications
should be acknowledged in the main text, not referenced (e.g.,
[Golovchinsky, personal communication]). References must be the same
font size as other body text. References should be in alphabetical
order by last name of first author. Use a numbered list of references
at the end of the article, ordered alphabetically by last name of
first author, and referenced by numbers in brackets. For papers from
conference proceedings, include the title of the paper and the name of
the conference. Do not include the location of the conference or the
exact date; do include the page numbers if available. 

References should be in ACM citation format:
\url{http://www.acm.org/publications/submissions/latex_style}.  This
includes citations to Internet
resources~\cite{CHINOSAUR:venue,cavender:writing,psy:gangnam}
according to ACM format, although it is often appropriate to include
URLs directly in the text, as above. Example reference formatting for
individual journal articles~\cite{ethics}, articles in conference
proceedings~\cite{Klemmer:2002:WSC:503376.503378},
books~\cite{Schwartz:1995:GBF}, theses~\cite{sutherland:sketchpad},
book chapters~\cite{winner:politics}, an entire journal
issue~\cite{kaye:puc},
websites~\cite{acm_categories,cavender:writing},
tweets~\cite{CHINOSAUR:venue}, patents~\cite{heilig:sensorama}, and
online videos~\cite{psy:gangnam} is given here.  See the examples of
citations at the end of this document and in the accompanying
\texttt{BibTeX} document. This formatting is a edited version of the
format automatically generated by the ACM Digital Library
(\url{http://dl.acm.org}) as ``ACM Ref.'' DOI and/or URL links are
optional but encouraged as are full first names. Note that the
Hyperlink style used throughout this document uses blue links;
however, URLs in the references section may optionally appear in
black.
