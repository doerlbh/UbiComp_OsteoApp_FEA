Morelle Hammer
Acc taped on to test whether the straps are dampening the signal
(1) Acc taped in middle of arm, hammer on the bottom
(2) Acc still taped with strap on top, hammer on bottom
(3) Something went wrong nothing saved ?
(4) Acc taped no strap with arm hitting table.

Conclusions: The rubber on the hammer is no bueno. Not transfering the energy to the arm. Better to hit with a metal or something really solid.
